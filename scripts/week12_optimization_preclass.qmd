In next week's class, we will use the `optimx` package to estimate the parameters of a logistic regression and compare the results to those obtained from the base `glm()` function. To prepare for this class, you need to prepare the data so that the following model can be fit:

$$
\text{logit}\left\{Pr(Y_{i} = 1)\right\} \beta_0 + \beta_1 E_{i} + \beta_2 D_{i}
$$
where 

* $Y_{i} = 1$ represents the **existence of an armed conflict in 2018** for country $i$ and $Y_{i} = 0$ otherwise
* $E_{i} = 1$ if country $i$ **ever** had an earthquake between 2010 and 2017 and $E_{i} = 0$ otherwise
* $D_{i} = 1$ if country $i$ **ever** had a drought between 2010 and 2017 and $D_{i} = 0$ otherwise

1. Prepare the data (\* *Remember that the armed conflict variable was lagged by one year when creating the final data!*)
2. Fit the logistic regression model using the `glm()` function in R
3. Complete the quiz
4. Install `optimx` from CRAN
